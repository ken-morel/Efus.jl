!!! NOTE
This is not very stable, but it works.

So good day, and welcome to `IonicEfus.jl` !

IonicEfus.jl is a module providing tools like
a language parser which transforms markup-like efus
language to julia code at macro expansion, a pair
of reactive constructs with tools to interact with
them easily all to help you build componentized structures
like ui's and maybe something else.

~I wrote wrote this documentation~ I am writing this
documentation to help you build your own component libraries
and backends, or use existing ones, or simply get to know
how to use what efus and ionic provide to you.

If you are looking fr example usecases, I also started
[Gtak.jl](https://github.com/ken-morel/Gtak.jl) bindings and
backend for Gtk4.jl and [Atak.jl](https://github.com/ken-morel/Atak.jl)
and [Gju.jl](https://github.com/ken-morel/Gju.jl) an example
application made with Gtak.jl.
